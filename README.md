Catching the ball is a game designed for a microbit board, it consists of moving a point in the lower part of the microbit matrix according to how many points fall, the objective is to capture them all.

Each of our jobs will consist of the documented makecode code, a video explaining how the game was designed and how it should be used, and the video that promotes the game and that we put together on social networks.
